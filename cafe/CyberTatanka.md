### LINUX ###
echo path -- shows the bin directory 
which echo 
which ls 
which id 
cd boot - goes into boot. When you ls boot it shows your versions. You can roll back to the kernel that is listed.
Adding functionality loads into exisiting 
cd dev -- eveything in a linux is a file. 
tty -- tell type terminals. running something that isn't a tell type terminal will produce errors. 
etc - all executables get loaded here. Configurations for particular tools are loaded here. 
lib - similar to dll dynamic link libraries in windows. Cache poisining is done here. 
cd media - The idea of mounting is too hard.
